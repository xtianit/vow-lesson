                    A vow is a solemn promise made audible or by the heart in
                    return for help requested from God in times of need. It is a
                    very effective mode of communicating and receiving from God
                    as revealed in the Holy scriptures. Consequetly, men have
                    often employed this strategy without cionsidering the
                    implications and have incurred God's wrath.

                   to vow and when we vow either verbally of in our heart, we should make haste to redeem it.
